# a python e-typewriter using eink and a USB keyboard
# this program outputs directly to the SPI eink screen, and is driven by a
# raspberry pi zero (or any pi). technically, it operates headless as the OS has no
# access to the SPI screen. it handles keyboard input directly via keyboard library.
#
# currently ONLY supports waveshare 4in2
